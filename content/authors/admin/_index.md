I am a Physics Ph.D. student at Drexel University, working under the supervision of Prof. [Gordon T. Richards](http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~gtr/GTR/GTR_Home.html). I study Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), which are believed to be powered by super-massive black holes living at the center of massive galaxies. At the moment, my primary research focus is the development of a new AGN classification algorithm for future large astronomical surveys like the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In the mean time, I employ stochastic modeling, in particular, the continuous-time autoregressive moving-average (CARMA) process, to investigate the physical properties of AGN accretion disks from the light curves. After all, I am always interested in applying modern machine learning techniques to tackle challenging problems introduced by ever-growing data set in astronomy.
